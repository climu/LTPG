# LTPG
The Learn to Play Go is intended as a modern interactive website for beginners to learn the basic rules and strategies (to a reasonable detail) of a Go (baduk) game without the need to register, or download anything.

Ideally it would serve as sort of a HUB for any new player to find his way to what he needs as the knowledge seems to be spread all over the internet.

The website runs on a simple .html, .css, and horrible .js + JGoBoard.js and WGo.js libraries

Test it on https://climu.github.io/LTPG/LTPG/


### This is a work in progress, some of the texts and puzzles are a bit half-assed, currently I am more concerned about some of the technical issues.

## Interactive puzzles
For the puzzles I am using a WGoBoard extension https://github.com/waltheri/wgo.js/tree/master/extensions/tsumego
The puzzles themselves are loaded externally from /puzzles directory.
