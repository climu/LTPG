The Learn to Play Go is intended as a modern interactive website for beginners to learn the basic rules and strategies (to a reasonable detail) of a Go (baduk) game without the need to register, or download anything.

Ideally it would serve as sort of a HUB for any new player to find his way to what he needs as the knowledge seems to be spread all over the internet.

The website runs on a simple .html, .css, and horrible .js + JGoBoard.js and WGo.js libraries
