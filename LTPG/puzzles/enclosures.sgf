(;GM[1]FF[4]AP[Drago:4.23]SZ[19]CA[UTF-8]AB[pd][qp]AW[dc][dp]C[Lets say first four moves are over. Nothing fancy going on, both players took their corners and now it is black's turn.

When nothing special is going on repeat this mantra: corners > sides > center. And if you do not know where to play, play the longes open side. After all there is the most space to get points.];B[op]LB[oq:A][nq:B][np:C][ce:D][de:E][cf:F][df:G][jp:H]C[The next course of action is either to make the most of one of yours corners or prevent your opponent from making the most of theirs. It is regarded as interchanchible

Black decided to encole his corner, but all the other letters would be perfectly good options too. And not only those.

Something like and around "H", while oldschool, is also playable.];W[qf]SQ[op][qp][oj][pd]LB[qg:A][qj:B][fq:C][ce:D]C[Now white approaches between the stones, to prevent black from building something too big too easily. Preventing a comfortable "double enclosure" of a single corner is often prioritized as the biggest move. It is not the only possibility though. White could try building something just as big, as her corners were not contested so far, but remember that black had the first move, so he will always be a step ahead in building.

A, B (oldschool), C, D, are but a few of other possibilities.];B[qi]SQ[qi][oi][op][qp][ol][oq]C[Black would now probably try attacking that stone a little to try and develop something as quickly as possible, but who knows. There are thousands of options and similar thought process will happen in all the other corners. When all corners are "settled" players will start developing sides and center. Now it maybe time for you to go and try your own game. Maybe check out beginner tips first?])
