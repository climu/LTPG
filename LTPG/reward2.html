<b>Still here, huh. Did you ask yourself why?</b><br><br><br>

I wondered once myself. Still have no real idea :D. Is it fun? Sometimes. Other times it is painfull. Constantly reminds us about our blatant imperfection. Certainly a humbling experience. But the people are kind.
Friends in suffering maybe. And the top is not even in sight.
<br><br>
And now that computers have shown us that there is a level of play even beyond what we imagined? You can safely assume that the top will be hidden in clouds forever. And yet we keep climbing.<br><br>
