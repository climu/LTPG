<div class="flavour"><hr>Full disclosure - this is a rule that may confuse you at first. But it is not as complicated as it may first seem. I for one (although many would disagree) think that a good ko fight is 
one of the most fun things you can have in a go game.<hr></div>

<!-- RULES -->
<b>Go games can take a long time. But must not ever be endless. To prevent the possibility of an endless game we have a rule, called ko.</b><br><br><br>

Just imagine a situation like this one. Given enough stubborness, those players would be playing until they pass out. (feel free to watch for a while)<br><br><br>
<img src="images/ko.gif" alt="liberties.jpg, 98kB" title="liberties" border="0" height="392" width="391"><br>
To prevent health problems connected with total fatigue we have this rule:<br><br>

<div class="podnadpis2"></span>A completely identical board position <span class="black">must not</span> appear twice in one game.</div><br>
<div class="podnadpis2"></span>Therefore, before you can recapture a stone that just captured yours, you have to <span class="black">play elsewhere once</span></div><br>

Now that we have established that you cannot immediately recapture a stone that just captured yours (The board would be exactly the same as before and that is prohibited). What are your options then?
Basically you have two:<br><br>
<span class="black">1.</span> You deem the stone not important and play elsewhere, letting your opponent end the ko by connecting his endangered stone if he wants to.<br>
<span class="black">2.</span> You deem the stone important enough to fight the ko. You still have to play elsewhere (of course) but you try to find a move your opponent will feel compelled to respond to locally (we call that a ko-threat).
<br><br>
<i>Confusing? Then check out the follwoing example, it will be clear in no time.</i><br><br>
